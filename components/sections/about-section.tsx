            Hello! I'm xAGENT, a cybersecurity professional specializing in threat detection, incident response, and
            security operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            With experience as a SOC Analyst and Microsoft Threat Expert, I focus on identifying and mitigating security
            threats across enterprise environments.

            <div className="space-y-2 text-sm">
              <p>
                I'm someone who thrives on challenges, whenever someone tells me something is impossible, my first
                thought is always "how can I make this possible?" This mindset drives me in both my personal and
                professional life.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm passionate about sports and physical fitness. Cricket is one of my favorite activities, and I also
                make time to hit the gym for at least an hour every day.
              </p>

              <p>
                Staying active is an important part of my routine that helps me maintain both physical and mental
                balance.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the football field, I play as a defender. While I didn't score many goals in that position, I took
                pride in preventing the opposition from scoring.
              </p>

              <p>
                Thinking about it now, it's interesting how that defensive mindset may have influenced my career
                pathâ€”perhaps that's what drew me to become a Defender endpoint expert in cybersecurity!
              </p>

          <p>
            I'm passionate about staying ahead of emerging cyber threats and implementing robust security measures to
            protect critical infrastructure and data.
          </p>
